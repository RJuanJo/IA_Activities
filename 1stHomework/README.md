# Activity I: Analysis of Regularization and Classification Techniques

Select a dataset (the Iris dataset is not accepted) to develop the following points:

### a. L1 and L2 Regularization in Classification Tasks
Explain in detail how L1 and L2 regularization work in classification tasks, and how they are implemented in sklearn.

### b. Cross-Entropy Loss in Logistic Regression
Research cross-entropy loss and how it is implemented in logistic regression. Develop the mathematical derivation to understand how gradient descent is applied to this loss function.

### c. multi_class Parameter in Logistic Regression
Explain the options for the multi_class parameter in the logistic regression classifier and how they function in sklearn.

### d. solver='sag' in Logistic Regression
Explain the use of solver='sag' in sklearn's logistic regression.

### e. SGDClassifier Class in sklearn
Explain the SGDClassifier class in sklearn.

### f. Encoding Categorical Data
Explain three different ways to encode categorical data, and what their advantages and disadvantages are.
